# Plum-DataAnalysis-Assignment

Assignment - Data Analyst
You will need to make a presentation in order to qualify. Why do we need you to take
this effort?
Detecting problems and streamlining solutions will need you to be detail oriented. To detail
journeys, you will need to read data in angles that will deliver the best solution. Reading data
and structuring a journey will only come with deep research. Deep research may not be
identified in a 45-minute conversation, which is the typical interview duration at Plum. Your
assignment will showcase to Plum on how you are thinking and what you are proposing.
There are no right or wrong answers, we will only measure your approach.
Here is the assignment.
Measuring math:
This data set is an outcome of how the customer success team at Plum is performing on
emails. Column C: Group indicates the different teams at Plum. Share a view on:
a. How are the efficiency numbers looking like? Can you share your views?
b. Which groups are quick, slow etc. Create a table + relevant charts.
c. What type of tickets are taking the most time to resolve? Create a table +
relevant charts.
d. Create the different type of data types we can infer from this data.

Method of presentation:
You may construct this over google slides or docs. Not capping the count of words / tables.
You also need to submit the underlying calculations which you have used to draw the
inferences.
